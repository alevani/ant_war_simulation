[Study on ants collective mechanisms during war between colonies of the same species](https://learnit.itu.dk/course/view.php?id=3020439#section-0)

## Introduction

### The context

This project is part of the "[Research project (K-CS and K-SD) Autumn 2020 (KIREPRO1PE)](https://learnit.itu.dk/course/view.php?id=3020186)" ITU course. The aim is to create a preliminary work for a Master thesis.



This project aims on studying the abstract mechanisms employed by ants during attack between colonies of the same species. Ants are one of the various social species that can be studied to create bioinspired algorithms and models of collective behaviors. They are very interesting because as a single unit, an ant is a very simple being, but as a swarm they show a lot of exciting collective behaviours and their underlying mechanisms can be studied and used for everyday problems.

### The subject

what will be studied and why

Bio-inspired robotic (or more commonly “Biomimetic”) is the art of studying the nature to replicate its behaviors into robotic to solve complex human problems. There are numerous examples such as the very famous “Japanese Bullet train” (Shinkansen) which gets its nose design from the Kingfisher bird’s beak (who’s aerodynamic ), reducing the train’s energy consumption by 15%, making it 10% faster and quieter. Other examples are the use of insect-inspired algorithms for coordination within groups of robots, on land, air, or even underwater.

### Goals

what should be the learning outcome and product outcome

### State of art

what exists?

Even though biomimetic on ants is a very studied topic with numerous papers, videos and books about the subject, there is no proper implementation of an ant war simulator. The closest implementations of it are simulations of pathfinders (here is an example found on Github: http://bwiklund.github.io/ant-simulator/). It is very likely that this project will be a reflection of all the studies, such as “Combat between large derived societies: A subterranean army ant established as a predator of mature leaf-cutting ant colonies” written by Scott Powell or “The Remarkable Self- Organization of Ants”, written by Emily Singer.
