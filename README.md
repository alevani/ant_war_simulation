# Question for supervisor

5. To what extend do I need to cite source? Alex: take example of the tasks description where I did not cite any ref. Should I do it there?
6. Should I have a chapter talking about war in ants ? 'Cause right now I am a bit worried about the fact that the name of the project does not match the content anymore.
